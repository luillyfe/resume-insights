# Enhanced Skill Extraction System

## Problem Statement
The current Resume Insights application has limitations in skill extraction and analysis:
1. Skills are displayed with random proficiency levels
2. No categorization of skills (technical, soft, domain-specific)
3. No estimation of experience duration for each skill
4. Limited to displaying only top skills due to API constraints

## Proposed Solution
Enhance the backend skill extraction system to provide more meaningful insights about candidate skills by:
1. Categorizing skills into relevant groups
2. Estimating proficiency based on experience
3. Calculating years of experience for each skill
4. Providing context about where skills were mentioned

## Technical Approach

### 1. Skill Data Structure
Create a more comprehensive skill representation:

```python
class SkillDetail:
    skill_name: str
    category: str  # "Technical", "Soft Skill", "Domain Knowledge", etc.
    proficiency: float  # 0-100 scale
    years_experience: float
    mentions: List[str]  # Contexts where the skill was mentioned
    related_skills: List[str]
```

### 2. Extraction Process
Modify the skill extraction process in the ResumeInsights class:

```python:/Users/luillyfe/Trae/resume-insights/resume_insights.py
def extract_skills_with_details(self, resume_text, work_history):
    """
    Extract skills with detailed information including categories, proficiency, and experience.
    
    Args:
        resume_text: The full text of the resume
        work_history: Parsed work history sections
        
    Returns:
        Dict[str, SkillDetail]: Dictionary of skills with their details
    """
    # 1. Extract raw skills using existing method
    
    # 2. Categorize skills using predefined taxonomies
    
    # 3. Calculate experience duration by analyzing work history sections
    
    # 4. Estimate proficiency based on:
    #    - Frequency of mentions
    #    - Recency of experience
    #    - Duration of experience
    #    - Context of mentions (e.g., "expert in X" vs "familiar with X")
    
    # 5. Find related skills
    
    return skill_details
```

### 3. LLM Prompting Strategy
Enhance the prompts sent to Gemini to extract more detailed skill information:

```
Given the resume text, please:
1. Identify all technical skills and categorize them (Programming Languages, Frameworks, Tools, etc.)
2. For each skill, estimate:
   - Proficiency level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
   - Years of experience based on work history
   - Where the skill was applied (project, job role)
3. Identify soft skills and domain knowledge
```

### 4. Chunking Strategy
To handle API payload limitations:
1. Process the resume in sections (education, work experience, projects)
2. Extract skills from each section independently
3. Merge and deduplicate results
4. Use a scoring system to prioritize skills when display limits are reached

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Structure and Basic Extraction
1. Define the SkillDetail class
2. Implement basic skill categorization
3. Update the extract_candidate_data method to include detailed skill information

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis
1. Implement experience duration calculation
2. Develop proficiency estimation algorithm
3. Add context extraction for skill mentions

### Phase 3: Integration and Optimization
1. Update the UI to display enhanced skill information
2. Optimize chunking for API payload limitations
3. Implement caching to improve performance

## Technical Challenges

1. **Accuracy of Experience Calculation**:
   - Dates in resumes may be incomplete or ambiguous
   - Skills might be mentioned without clear timeframes

2. **Skill Categorization**:
   - New or niche skills may not fit into predefined categories
   - Some skills may span multiple categories

3. **API Limitations**:
   - Need to balance detail vs. payload size for Gemini API
   - May require multiple API calls for comprehensive analysis

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: Compare AI-estimated proficiency with self-reported levels
2. **Completeness**: Percentage of skills correctly categorized
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on usefulness of skill insights
4. **Performance**: Processing time and API usage efficiency

## Future Enhancements

1. Skill gap analysis for specific job roles
2. Skill trend analysis over time
3. Personalized skill development recommendations
4. Integration with industry skill databases for standardization

This design provides a comprehensive approach to enhancing the skill extraction capabilities of the Resume Insights application, addressing the current limitations while setting the foundation for future improvements.
